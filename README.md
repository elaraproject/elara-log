# elara-log

This is an **old version** of the `elara-log` library. It is now developed [in a new repository](https://github.com/elaraproject/elara-log-ng) and this old version should be considered **deprecated**. We keep it here only for compatibility purposes; users are advised to switch to the [new version of this crate](https://crates.io/crates/elara-log-ng).
